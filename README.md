# COEN-12
Abstract Data Structures and Data Types in C

Hello there! This repository contains the projects I created during my abstract data structures class (COEN-12) in the spring of 2020.

Here is a brief summary of each project:

Project 1: I created a short, simple program to familiarize myself with different runtimes and complexities (expressed in Big-O notation.

Project 2: I created a simple program to count the number of words in a text file.

Project 3: I implemented a Set ADT using both a sorted and unsorted array (with sequential and binary search algorithms) to store strings and generic pointer types for the user program.

Project 4: I implemented a Set ADT using a hash table (with linear probing) to store strings and generic pointer types. This ADT allowed the number of unique words in a file (various books in this case) to be counted extremely fast.

Project 5: I implemented a Set ADT to be used in a maze solving program using a doubly-ended queue (deque) and a hash table (hashing with chaining). I created the deque using a linked list with a sentinel (dummy) node to simplify the various functions.

Project 6: I created a priority queue ADT using a binary heap (implemented as an array) to work alongside a Huffman coding algorithm to compress a given file (in this case various books). Through this project, I learned about the utility of data ompressions (albeit in a primitive form) and the powerand speed of heaps.

Final Project: In my final project, I combined a linked list with an array in order to implement stack and queue operations with efficient indexing. In other words, I combined the best of features of both arrays and linked lists! This ADT dynamically grows to accomodate the data (of any type) and allows for fast look-ups and deletions.
